# GuitarAutoTune

This code was developed in a multidisciplinary team. The core algorithm calculates the fundamental frequency of the captured sound per sample and then sends commands to an electrical engine conected to the guitar keys. It was executed in a Raspberry Pi. My main contributions to the code were the real time fundamental frequency detection algorithm (based in HPS) and audio filters.
